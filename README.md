# My config Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files for a complete, keyboard-driven desktop environment on Arch Linux. The setup is built around `bspwm` as the window manager, with `polybar` for the status bar and `rofi` for application launching and menus. The entire aesthetic is based on the **Gruvbox Dark Soft** color scheme and the **JetBrains Mono Nerd Font**.

## Philosophy

* **Keyboard-First:** Every common action, from launching apps to managing windows and system settings, is accessible via a keyboard shortcut.
* **Minimal & Performant:** Only lightweight and essential software is used, ensuring a fast and responsive experience.
* **Visually Cohesive:** All components, from the terminal to the notifications, are themed with the Gruvbox palette for a consistent look and feel.
* **Informative & Interactive:** The status bar and menus are not just for display; they are interactive tools to manage the system.
